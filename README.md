When run, the algorithm runs inside of a for loop that allows the algorithm to be tested on arrays of different sizes.  The code writes runtime data for the algorithm to a file called "Project_Data.txt" in the following format:

Array Size:     T(n):     T(n)/n:

Where T(n) is the time it takes to run the algorithm on an array of size n.  The algorithm is known to be linear, meaning  T(n) = cn  for some constant c which is dependent on computing power.  Consequently, the value T(n)/n should be the same for arrays of any size.
